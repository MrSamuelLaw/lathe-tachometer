# lathe-tachometer
A repository that details the analysis, design, and coding of an arduino and hall effect based tachometer. 

The analysis folder details how the components were measured to create 
an optimal output from the hall effect sensor for the arduino to read.

The algorithm_design folder details how the algorithm that detects rpm bounce, 
indicating that a machine error is likely, was developed.
